### Week Nine [week Hebdomada Octo]

This week introduced us to logging and digital forensics logs are vital for understanding what has happened in the event of a secuity event or even in the event of a system problem logs act as the digital fingerprints to allow you to see what the system did and when it did it

What is the purpose of Logging the UK ICO says on the subject "It is to enable you to monitor and audit internal processing within any automated processing systems you use, and to know which third parties you have shared data with so that you can inform them of changes to the data should you need to. In addition, logging enables you to monitor systems for inappropriate access and/or disclosure of data, to verify the lawfulness of any processing, and to ensure the integrity and security of personal data." (ICO https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-le-processing/accountability-and-governance/logging/)

When Logging information what we log can generally be split into the 4Ws 

## Who ##
Who (user) or Who (Application / Process) is carrying out the event that is being logged this is especially important on remote and multiuser systems as in these cases it can be harder to identify the user(s) who where responisble for the action being investigated.

## What ##
What happned this shows what actually happend this is the key part of logging in that we actually capture information on the operation the device or service is carrying out as this will allow the investigation of the series of events leading up to and after the incident or event being investigated.
