### Week Ten [week Hebdomada Decem]

a lot of this week was taken up looking at data breeches and how these should be responded to while a data breech is not a situation any company wants to find itself in as this means something has failed either technology or information governance. How companies deal with breeches is whatâ€™s important. the UK ICO states 
We have in place a process to assess the likely risk to individuals as a result of a breach.

- We have a process to inform affected individuals about a breach when their rights and freedoms are at high risk.
- We know we must inform affected individuals without undue delay. 
- We know who is the relevant supervisory authority for our processing activities.
- We have a process to notify the ICO of a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, even if we do not have all the details yet.
- We know what information we must give the ICO about a breach.
- We know what information about a breach we must provide to individuals, and that we should provide advice to help them protect themselves from its effects.
- We document all breaches, even if they donâ€™t all need to be reported ICO (2021)

The Second half of the week was spent researching our case study and preparing some slides to present this was actually quite enjoyable and I think it proved to myself that I could talk about the subject and actually sound like i knew what i was talking about. Having been on both sides of a data breech and the post data breech work also I think gave me a good insight when talking about the data breech.

Next week the plan is to refine the submission before the final submission date and to cut the number of words down to match the limit as currently our introduction and background section is over the 2000 word limit so we will need to review and cut out sections that donâ€™t add value to the final report generally feeling ok though would have liked more actual security content to make it into the final report we did rescan to site to see if it suffered from the published log4j exploit but it does appear to be affected by this.
