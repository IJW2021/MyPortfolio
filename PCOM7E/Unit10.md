### Week Ten [week Hebdomada Novem]

alot of this week was taken up looking at data breeches and how these should be responded to while a data breech is not a situation any company wants to find itself in as this means something has failed either technology or infomation governance. How companies deal with breeches is whats important. the UK ICO states 



We have in place a process to assess the likely risk to individuals as a result of a breach.

- We have a process to inform affected individuals about a breach when their rights and freedoms are at high risk.
- We know we must inform affected individuals without undue delay. 
- We know who is the relevant supervisory authority for our processing activities.
- We have a process to notify the ICO of a breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, even if we do not have all the details yet.
- We know what information we must give the ICO about a breach.
- We know what information about a breach we must provide to individuals, and that we should provide advice to help them protect themselves from its effects.
- We document all breaches, even if they donâ€™t all need to be reported
