## Attendees ##
Alice, Ian, Aidan    Apologies: Lukman
## Agenda ##
Draft of the Pentesting Plan
Section 3/4 needs some more details - specifically about the GDPR, ISO, Payment Card
Parts of the Projects - who wants to cover what
Alice had made a draft assignment - we all need to look into Section 4 and section 7.
Lukman is going to make the timeline.

## Notes ##
We  spoke about the outline of the project and have a couple of questions for Nawaz about it. What do we need to put in for the access part (seeing as it is our website and we donâ€™t really need to ask for permission)? Do we need to include social engineering attacks? If so, in what section?
Action Items
Make comments on initial draft of project.
Give Nawaz a draft of the proposal so we can get some initial feedback.
Aidan will research about regulatory compliance in section 4.
Ian will present his results for the presentation in Seminar 2 about the initial tests that he carried out.
Next Meeting Agenda
Start the practical scanning jobs. Decide who is doing what!
