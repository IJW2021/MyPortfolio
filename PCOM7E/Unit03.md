### Week Three [week Duo]
During This week I started by carrying out some work with the  Kali Linux security toolset so I could get a better understanding of the tools that I will be using for the network discovery and reconnaissance phase of our team project. I had used some of these tools in the past and during some CTF events I had attended but it was good to learn some new tools while getting a refesher in some of the classic tools that make up the pentesters toolkit. For this and due to having access to a VMWARE server I also built a number of VMs (Windows , Linux , Solaris) in order to do some testing with the tools. So far quite happy with how the current module is going as it has a good mix of pratical and theory.

Also Started to put together a userful wensites and resoures spreadsheet that we could use during the pentest phase of the project
