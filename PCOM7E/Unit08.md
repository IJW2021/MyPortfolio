### Week Eight [week Hebdomada Octo]

Another GDPR Week looking at the GDPR and how this releates to our website I think that GDPR is going to form a large part of our final submission as out of the box from the work we have done the site appears to be quite secure using the latest version of most of the server software but there are definitely issues on the compliance side that I feel will need to be addessed by our virtual client This week I also completed a GDPR case study looking at a real world example of when a company ended up in court over a violation of GDPR. In my case this was a irish Medical Company (River Medical)

### Forum Post ###

Case Study Sheldon Investments Limited Trading as River Medical
For This Discussion I chose Sheldon Investments Limited this study relates to the repeated sending of unsolicited marketing emails to an individual who did not opt in to receiving these emails. 

### Background ###

The background to this case is in September 2015 a complaint was received by the Irish ICO in regard to Sheldon Investments ltd alleging that unsolicited spam messaging had been received with out opting in to receiving commercial communications the complainant also stated that his relationship with the company was a result of a consultation at which a form had to be completed on which he stated he did not wish to receive commercial communications.
In April 2015 he received advertisement communications because of this he answered the E-mail and asked for his details to be removed from the mailing list. In response a confirmation email was duly received informing the subject that his details had been removed from the mailing list. Even though confirmation was received he went on to receive more marketing email messages. A complaint was then lodged with the data commissioner's office. (201713 The Data Protection Commission (DPC))

### GDPR ###

This case falls under Article 21 of the GDPR that states that ‚Äúwhere personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing‚Äù and that ‚Äúwhere the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, (GDPR 2016) this clearly did not happen in this case and then to compound the error even when the data subject had re-requested that he not be contacted by marketing emails he still received further unwanted communications.

### Company Response Case 1 ###
In response to the complaint the company stated that the mistake was due to "Human Error" the response was "It had made the file inactive but did not realise it needed to manually delete the file from the systems"

### Outcome Investigation Case 1 ###
Following an investigation that finished in December 2015 the company was issued with a warning with advice that any additional breaches would likely lead to prosecution proceedings against the company.

### Background Part II ###
Subsequent to the investigation 12 months later (December 2016) the individual submitted another complaint after further commercial emails were received from River Medical 

### Company Response Case 2 ###
The Company once again stated that the cause was "Human Error" caused by an incorrect mailing list being used in sending out the marketing material.

### Outcome Investigation Case 2 ###
Due to the previous warning the Information Commissioner moved ahead with a prosecution in this case which was held at Dublin Metro District court (03.07.2017) where the accused pled guilty to two charges of sending unsolicited emails without consent.
The court sought a charitable payment to "Focus Ireland" ("Focus Ireland was founded by Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy as a result of the finding of research into the needs of women experiencing homelessness in Dublin." https://www.focusireland.ie/who-we-are/about-us/) of eight hundred euros plus prosecution costs.

### Outcome ###  
Following proof of payment, the court struck out the charges.

### Thoughts ###
If I was the information security manager for Sheldon I would put in a couple of changes to stop any further breaches the first of these would be to simplify the process of obtaining and recording a clients opt in / opt out status as well as proving some method for the client to change their status without needed to email the company.
I would also ensure that once a mailing list is no longer required it is removed to prevent situations where the wrong list is used i.e. apply an appropriate data retention and archiving policy along with having compliance training for staff who deal with direct marketing.

Looking torwards next week hopfully we can move on from GDPR back onto some more practical topics as GDPR while important in all our lives is quite a dry subject so mixing theory with some more practical topics shouls stop ‚úã us burning out. On the team side I want to see if we can get together first of all to dicuss the submission but also because the other team members have good ideas and the whole is greater then the sum of its parts and the more we communicate the better I feel the final product will be. Still a bit frustrating that we have not been able to find any actual security exploits for our test site but I guess that is like the real world where not every job is one where you get to show your pentest skills but it would have been nice to show what we have been learning. üë®‚Äçüè´
