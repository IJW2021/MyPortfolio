### Week Five [week Hebdomada Quinque]

This week has mostly been a project week with setting the direction of the project work this has been going well and the team I am in appears to be a good team full of people who know what is needed in order to deliver a successful project. 

We are going to try and divide the project into the following stages to align with some project management best practice

<ul>
  <li>Definition</li>
<li>Initiation</li>
<li>Planning</li>
<li>Execution</li>
<li>Monitoring & Control</li>
<li>Closure</li>
</ul>

I have also been looking in more detail at TCP/IP networking using wirehark and tcpdump to look at the data at the packet level while not 100% happy with my understanding at the moment was interesting to see the data being trasmitted by our devices and how this can potentialy be captured and analysed. 
### TCP Packet Structure

**TCP DUMP**

Example output from the command line version of TCP dump showing packet capture from the en0 (Wireless) adapter

```console
sudo tcpdump -vv -i en0
```
