### Week One [una sabbatorum]

The first week of a new module is always interesting as you are leaving behind content that you have studied for a number of weeks and venturing on a new journey and new content a large part of the first week was spent looking at the overview of the module and what will be required as the deliveiables. The second part of the first week was spent putting myself into a team. I was happy ðŸ˜ƒ that my team had a mixture of people that I had spoken to before and new people. The team we have is apepars to have a good mix of skills that should allow for some good work to be produced.  

Druring this week as a team we put into place the technology solutions that would allow us to comuniucate effectively during the group working parts of the module the solution we went with was **Discord** for the voice and **Google Docs** and **Google drive** for our shared colbaration toolset While not personally a fan of google docs as a solution to enable joint working it should work better then soultions such as Micosoft word which would not allow the level of joint working we need going forward in this project.

Looking forrward to learning the new content this shoudl be a good module as not only is the content bound to be interesting it has a real word application which cannot be a bad thing. Time will tell isf my prediction comes true but I have a good feeling about our team and the work ahead.
