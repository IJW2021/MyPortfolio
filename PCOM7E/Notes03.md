## Agenda and Meeting Notes ##
Discuss Nawaz’s Feedback
The timeline is missing
Tools selection and evaluation methodology can be reviewed critically in line with the methodologies discussed in the class, DREAD, STRIDE, etc.
Can use tables to show the mapping between tools-impacts-standards.
Too many screenshots with a lot of texts, you may redraw some of these in the form of a diagram.
Mapping and linking the sections to each other can make the document more coherent.

Decide on Responsibilities for 3rd Draft
Lukman - add the timeline
Alice - make the document more coherent between the sections  - ensure we use STRIDE and DREAD
Ian - Map between the tools and the standards
Aidan - review the tables, cut some of the text, use diagrams
