### Week One [una sabbatorum]

The First Week has mostly been looking at what information systems are and the differences between information data and knowledge 

**DATA + MEANING = INFORMATION** 

**DATA + [STRUCTURE]+[CONTEXT]+MEANING = INFORMATION** 

**What is Data**

| Item            | Description |
| :--             | :--
| Data            | Facts and Figures | 
| Structure	      | How The Data is presented |
| Context	Prior   | Understanding of the data |
| Meaning	        | Data in the correct structure placed within context |
| Knowledge	      | The application of information to a solution |

As part of my week one work I made my first forum post looking at an example of where an information system failed for this I selected Düsseldorf Hospital as my example in my initial forum post.

## Forum Post

The incident I want to look at is the failure of the Information systems at Düsseldorf  hospital Germany 2010, that unfortunately as the result of this IT system failure led to the death of a patient.The background to this case was that the hospital suffered a cyber attack that breached their perimeter network defences through an unpatched Citrix VPN software flaw CVE-2019-19781(Citrix, 2019; MITRE, 2019) (Busvine Douglas and Kaeckenhoff Tom, 2021) The flaw in the software had been known about for several months before the attack too place but it remained unpatched though the Hospital disputes this. As a result of this attack the IT systems that support the day-to-day operations of the hospital started failing this resulted in the hospital having to engage their emergency plan. incoming patients were redirected to another local hospital in the city of Wuppertal approx. 18.6 Miles (30km) away. (Press Associated, 2020)

For one patient this transfer resulted in a delay of an hour to her treatment potentially contributing to her death.
The initial attack on the information systems of the hospital caused system failures in key email and communication (Telephone) services. After a day of the hospital trying to deal with the issues caused by these system failures internally the hospital had to be removed from providing emergency care along with also having to reschedule routine operations and procedures.

Following the incident and the police investigation that took place it was found that thirty servers had been encrypted with ransomware with the malicious software providing contact details for where a ransom could be paid.

Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case in the healthcare realm. The NHS in the UK had upward of 20000 appointments cancelled or rescheduled when their network and IT systems was infected with the WannaCry ransomware. (National Audit Office, 2018)

These sorts of information system failures caused due to deliberate actions by rogue third parties rather than the traditional software failure points such as poor requirements gathering, poor software design or failures in software implementation are the new reality of IT system design. Unlike errors in design or errors in coding that we have tried and tested methods to overcome. These failures are hard to plan for and hard to defend against. In most cases it is not just a failure of an Information system and the processes and services, they support but it is most likely also a failure of underlying business processes and user training.

This Is because unlike other causes of system failure where the flaw may have been introduced in the very early stages of the software design process before the customer even took delivery of the system. In a failure of a information system due to a security compromise it can still be the case that a security flaw is introduced in the design stage that ultimately fails the system but there is nearly always a human factor involved in the attack (Ghafur et al.) and therefor the subsequent system failure is not just a technology problem with a system. Some examples of the human factor can be users opening attachments in emails allowing the bad actors ingress onto a secure network or being convinced to give out restricted information that allows a breach of a system via a social engineering attack or IT support staff failing to keep systems up to date with the latest Hot fixes and service packs.

While some of these attacks vectors can be mitigated by having up to date antivirus and keeping IT systems patched to fix flaws once identified. Along with having security technologies deployed to defend the network and key systems. This with adopting a security first approach to staff training would have helped defend against the flaws exposed in this case. The human factor however is unpredictable. As one quote puts it “A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely fool proof is to underestimate the ingenuity of a complete fool”  (Adams Douglas, 2000)

In This example we can see the failures of IT systems either by poor design, poor implementation, poor management or by malicious intent can have real world consequences. In this case, it had the ultimate consequence as it could have contributed to the death of a patient. While it can be disputed if the system failure itself actually caused the death of the woman any system failure in information systems supporting life critical services can have major consequences. As IT professionals we are not use to flaws in a system we design and implement having these direct impacts on life.
