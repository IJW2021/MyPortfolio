### Week Eight [Hebdomada Octo]

A look into NOSQL being a long term SQL person (Oracle , MSSQL , MYSQL) took a while to get my head around the concept of NOSQL to the point of having to fire up a couple of docker images (CouchDB and MongoDB) so I could have a hands on play with the technology along with looking at structured and unstructured data. Not sure if itâ€™s because being a SQL diehard but not sure if the NOSQL technology is at a point where it should replace all traditional SQL DBMS system especially as some of these MSSQL POSTGRES now also include NOSQL options giving the best of both worlds within a single DBMS used this as my form post. But can see the advantage of document store nosql when paired to something like python for the easy storage and retrieval of dictionary data structures. Interesting topic and one that I will be revisiting in the future to see how the landscape of SQL / NOSQL has changed. 

**Forum Post**

In Thinking about NOSQL we really need to think about data rather than DBMS platform NOSQL is a solution that came out of the need to store and search non structured data there are many options for NOSQL but the one I am going to look at is POSTGRES as this is a traditional SQL DB but also has the ability to store data in NOSQL data structures giving the best of both worlds the maturity of the PostgreSQL platform along with the cutting edge NOSQL Features. Along with established tooling for the management of the DBMS platform which can.

Advantage of Postgres as NOSQL database (Anon)

1.	Established Platform with Easy Arability of DBAs and Trained resources
2.	Wide number of integration and connector options
3.	Tooling to manage database is mature and cross platform
4.	Ability to Combine NOSQL and SQL Data in One Database

While there are more advance NOSQL options CouchDB , MongoDB etc the Postgres option is a good gateway into the NOSQL world for organisations who have been traditional SQL users but who want to
