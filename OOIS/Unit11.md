### Week Eleven [Hebdomada undecim]

This Week consisted of looking at Flask and webservices learnt a lot and wish I could have put some of it into my development project as having the additional knowledge I picked up this week would have caused some of my design decisions to be different but a positive as now have additional knowledge and skills. Also, this week the implementation needed to be submitted and this as mentioned previously was not a smooth process with codio and git branch issues so emotional outlook was fairly negative this week as stupid mistake to make and should have known better but canâ€™t change the past so carried on working through the material. Not the most positive week but hoping next week will be better.
