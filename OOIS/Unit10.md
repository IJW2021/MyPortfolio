### Week Ten [Hebdomada Decem]


Some more SQL this week Inner Joins left joins and outer joins all very familiar but always good to refresh the fundamentals. The More interesting section this week was the creating a system based on a design document as there are usually two forces at force 1. What the customer wants and needs and 2. What has been documented in the requirements document. This is one reason why developers should not create design documents In an ideal world it should be done by a BA (Business Analyst) and then Developers build the system from the specifications.  From my reading around the subject opinion appears to be split over how design documents should be produced but the one area where everyone agrees is these should be living documents that adapt as the requirements change during the implementation phase of any project. This is why they tend to be stored in some form of collaborative workspace tool that allows all parties access (SharePoint, Google Docs etc) happy with the content this week but would like to know more about the best way to produce design documents as for projects I work on I have produced SAD (Standard Architecture design) and PID (Project Initiation Documents) but if there is a better way would like to know. Still happy to be working with data.
