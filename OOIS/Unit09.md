### Week Nine [Hebdomada Novem]

Another good week though some of that may be down to lots of experience with SQL which I have used pretty much every day in my professional life. 
When you know SQL you have all the tools you need to slice and dice data anyway you need it.  Still learning NOSQL but after initial doubts beginning 
to see the advantage though with my professional hat on the tooling available for management of NOSQL databases still has a way to go in order to be on par 
with the traditional SQL DBMS systems. It would also be nice to have some sort of cross platform NOSQL language support though even after 40+ years Traditional 
SQL has not 100% mastered that as Microsoft and oracle still had their own extensions to the ANSI SQL standards. 
But in whole a Positive week and looking forward to putting some of the NOSQL skills into practice. 

With all the recent SQL and NOSQL work will have to look into the options on the implementation project and if I want to change the DBMS I am using or migrate to one
of the ones I have been learnaing about as a data person happy we are now doing real world work theory is important but always nice to get hands on.
