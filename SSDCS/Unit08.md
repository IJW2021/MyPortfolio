### Week Eight [Hebdomada Octo]

Positive but also slightly anoying start to the week on the postive side infrastructure build out is on schedule even with our change to base os which is turning out to be a good decision as a our VM images have reduced in size from 150GB per VM down to about 9GB per image while storage is not a big concern our current storage array has a 8TB ZFS pool smaller is better on a secuirty side as it means the attack surface of the OS underpinning our service is reduced.

Along with the actual delivery we need to think about our Disaster recovery position as a solutuon needs to be able to recover from unforseen events and as our domain is in a hostile environment this is important. To this regard as part of our plan is to include backup and recovery solution as the industry leader and because there is a free tier we have gone with a VEEAM based solution.
