### Week Six [Hebdomada Sex]

In what may turn out to be not the smartest decision spent the best part of the weekend re-engineering the infratructrue side of the project to remove the requirment to have a windows active directory which is somewhat ironic as it was me who pushed for a identity directory over storing user details in a database. But my reason was to have a estate made up of a single platform as this presents a smaller vector for any exploits then having a mixed esate. Time will tell id we can totally remove windows form the platform at the very least we will need to test on windows as for a testing to be effective we need to test on all potential devices that could use the service.
