Some say that people are the biggest risk of cyber security this from experience unfortunately tends to be the case people are often the weak link in any security system but a lot of these risks can be overcome using the following technologies.

**Access control** restricting physical access to the underlying servers running the services this however is limited to on premise hardware with the increase in the use of SAAS, IAAS and cloud services local physical access control is no longer enough an organization also need to partner with a cloud vendor who has good datacentre security made up of the following 

*	Secure Perimeter
*	Building Signage
*	Building Access
*	Security Operations Centre
*	Restricted Access to Data Centre Floor
*	Secure Hard Disk Destruction

**Audit** while this in itself will not stop incidents it will allow to see who was responsible and what was done ideally, we would want our system audit and logging to use a daemon such as syslog where logs can be offloaded onto a secondary server this prevents the altering of logs if a machine is comprised. Audit should also feed into the organizations IDS to proactively identify threat behaviour outside of normal so that an early Response can take place to prevent further breech of security. 

**Authentication** is the process of proving identity to a system or process one example of this is logging on to a computer the users account is authenticated by a means of an authentication method (password, Token, Biometrics) and then once authenticated the users account is permitted to logon to the device. We can overcome some of the human element by forcing Authentication to carry out tasks that have a security impact.

**Policy** an organization should have a well defined policy in regard to IT security including mandatory training (Annual) of all staff in security best practice as this will limit a security incident being caused by the human factor due to the staff being aware of security risks and their own responsibility in helping preventing breeches of security.
