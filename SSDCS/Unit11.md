![Logo](Images/Diary.png)

This week Final big push on the coding project split my time between updating my code and writing the documentation for the team for a small team with big ideas we have come a long way since our first meeting to dicuss which project domain we wanted to do. And personally have learned so much. The freedom to go with a idea and produce a design and a solution with quite wide boundrys was really vaulable as it allowed us to go places where we would not have been able to go otherwise. 

That being said as with any project you shoud always do a lessons learnt excerise and there have been decsions made during the project that if I was to do it again.
