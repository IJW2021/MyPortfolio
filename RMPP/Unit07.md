### Week Seven [Hebdomada Septem]

Sumission week have submitted the reveiw document am I 100% happy with it no this was well outside of my comfort zone give me a python or c++ problem could do that no problem but this has exposed some areas of computing where I feel I do struggle with so this is a area I will loook to improve. That being said the document I produced I am fairly happy with but think some of the arguments I put forward could be stronger. One of the areas I did find difficult was finding the papers to read for the topic though google scholler did provide a good starting point.

Now that the first part has been submitted I need to start to think about the presentation part while I am not naturally a good public speaker I have some ideas about what I want to do for the second submission. I think i will be using the same topic as in the Review topic as I have some good content that I can put into a presentation. I am however beginning to feel a bit overwhelemed by all the content so may need to take a step back and regroup befofe the next phase of the module
