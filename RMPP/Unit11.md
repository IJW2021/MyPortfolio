### Week Eleven [Hebdomada undecim]

End of the module and itâ€™s been a journey have I enjoyed the module I think itâ€™s fair to say given a free choice It is not one I would have personally chosen to do I think my brain is more wired for the practical side of CS give me a problem and I will find a solution and produce a product that will solve the problem. Which is good as that is how I make my living. That being said the module has made me think quite a bit as apart from the maths where there is 100% a correct answer the other parts open up interpretation and in a lot of ways are dictated by individual experience and personal moral compass. So, it was nice to travel down that road even for just a bit but will also be happy to get back algorithms, DMBS optimisation writing efficient secure code.   

The Royal Air Force have a moto **Per ardua ad astra** which translates to through adversity to the stars and that I think is how I feel having completed the module will I use what I have learned in the real world? yes Ethics I use every day to guide what I do as IT professionals we tend to have access to quite sensitive data so being able to know what can be done and who we can give that data to is a skill we all need. Otherwise, it makes for less than pleasant discussions with internal and external agencies. As someone who has had to report failures to the ICO itâ€™s something I am very aware of. Personally, Disappointed with my own performance in this module not sure why some of the unforced errors happened but not something I plan to repeat we cannot change the past only learn from it so will take this as a lesson learn from it and try to do better going forward.
