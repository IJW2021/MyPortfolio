### Week Three [Tres Sabbati]

After last week looking forward to some more details on what we will need to produce for the assignment part of the module though before that spent a good part of the week reading though the material while not the most engaging material ever written the topics covered did all tie together quite nicely the topics of how we classify research and how we should design a research program.
Starting to get a bit of an understanding of how we should classify research into three set areas

- Exploratory Research
- Conclusive Research
- Qualitative Research

Starting to look at the topics for the review while not personally a fan of a majority of the topics leaning towards the COVID19 data reporting and dashboards topic as data is a area that I am quite familiar with and even have some experience of dashboards and covid19 so makes sense to do research in a area that I already have some knowledge of. That being said from what I have seen so far this looks like it could be quite a challenging module but will go in with a positive attitude.

To help with this before next week will carry on with the background reading and may try to tap some of my own work contacts who have their doctorates to get some advice on how to best approach the upcoming work.


### Seminar 2 Preparation

For the Seminar 2 Excersise the First Paper I looked at was 

Programming Languages: A Survey Kumar, Krishan 2019  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337562079_Programming_Languages_A_Survey


This I feel used the Conclusive Research method as it was taking raw figures and was trying to draw conconclusions from the data being extarcted in this example the spread of development languages be used. if we look at the questions

- In terms of data collection and analysis, is this also appropriate for the stated purpose or question? (
- Does each paper support its claims and conclusions with explicit arguments or evidence?
- How would you enhance the work/paper?

1. The data collection does initially apepar to be appropriate taking in the data from more then one source from the paper the folloing passage shows that data is sampled from a number of sources but for the example of dvelopment language use this includes the worlds biggest source of online code Github 

```synthesizes  12 metrics  from 10 sources  to arrive at an overall  ranking  of  language  popularity".[22] The  various  metrics  were  collected  from GitHub, Google Search and Trends, Twitter, Stack  Overflow, Reddit, Hacker  News, Career  Builder, Dice.com,  and IEEE  Xplore  Digital Library. The interactive ranking application[23] allows adjustment of each metric's weight, and also filtering languages by "type" (Web, Mobile, Enterprise, Embedded).```

2. Evidence is presented to support the arguments including data dervived both from Adedemia , Business and proffessional orginzations the data presented does appear at surface value to support the conclusions but the choice of data presented is also an important factor as selective selections of datasets could be used to support an argument the choice of what data to include is an important metric but as presented conclusions are drawn from evidence.

3. To improve the study I would include a wider range of data from a wider industry and geolocation viewpoint the language used by modern startups may differ from those used by more established industry. Along with languages used in 1st world locations (USA,Europe,Asia) may differ from those used in developing areas.
