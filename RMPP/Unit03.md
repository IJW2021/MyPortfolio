### Week Three [Tres Sabbati]

After last week looking forward to some more details on what we will need to produce for the assignment part of the module though before that spent a good part of the week reading though the material while not the most engaging material ever written the topics covered did all tie together quite nicely the topics of how we classify research research and how we should design a research program.

Starting to get a bit of a understanding of how we shoud classify research into three set areas

- Exploratory Research
- Conclusive Research
- Qualitative Research


Starting to look at the topics for the review while not persoanlly a fan of a majority of the topics leaning torwards the COVID19 data reporting and dashboards topic
