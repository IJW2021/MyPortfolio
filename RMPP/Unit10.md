### Week Ten [Hebdomada Decem]

During unit 10, I continued the work into code quality and how to write high quality maintainable code along with this to try and get a better understanding of how these linters work and the decisions they make spent a good amount of time reading the official PEP8 python style guide Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, Nick Coghlan https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.7.x/ while I personally donâ€™t agree with everything contained in the guide max line length of 79 characters being a particular bugbear https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length having a style guide is an important factor as it allows us to have as far as possible a common framework on how to write well structured code in a style that another developer could pick up the code and understand what is contained and how to add to the codebase. This is important because when we look at commercial code development a majority of the work a developer will do involves additions or maintenance to existing codebases rather than virgin development of new applications and solutions.

**Python Linters** 

The Two main Linters in use in the python ecosystem are Pylint and Flake8 we can also include other code analysis tools such as bandit and sonarqube and Black. The output of the two main linters are shown below

**Pylint**

**Flake8**

After running pylint and flake8 numerous times, I worked through the error messages attempting to resolve the issues that had been highlighted this was a time consuming task made more difficult by pylints rather preachy interpretation of the style guide which why Flake8 was my preferred linter it was however a worthwhile exercise as the resulting code was more robust and more closely aligned with the Python style guide. I also found that both these tools have docker images so might have to look at adding these to our GitHub action pipeline along with the docker build action. 

Project is still progressing we need to submit the presentation next week so one more big push to get it delivered have asked the team if they can record the transcripts for the parts of the system they did. With me doing the fill in the blanks. so, once that is done, I will see if I can get a day off work to put the presentation together before passing it to the rest of the team for final review and signoff.
