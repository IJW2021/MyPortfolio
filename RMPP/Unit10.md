### Week Ten [Hebdomada Decem]

So have made it to week 10 and this is the week where my proposal presentation needs to be completed and submitted. Progress has been pretty good and apart from a microphone not working when plugged in to a Macbook no problems in recording the voice over sections really dont like to hear myself speak wihout a audience as there is nothing to fill the voids in the presentation but we shoudl be ok for submission one thing that I did overlook was due to the fact tha the audio was recorded at CD quality 44khz WAV files the size of the presentation was quite large it may have been better to reencode as MP3 or AAC but checked and the filesize was still below the limit for the VLE Moodle environment.  

Have also been having a think about project Ideas while debating if I carryon to the MSC part of the course for a number of reasons decided to at least have a idea about what to do if and when I make that decison. As someone who has a keen iterest in both city design and green issues I wanted to look at some of these types of issues research for research sake is a valid point of view as it enhances the pool of human knowledge. But on a personal level I would like my research to have a possible real world application. 

**Initial Proposal Ideas**

- Active Transport Planning how to design clener cities

| Idea  |
|---|
| Use GIS To Visulaise Data  |
| Hook into Realtime Traffic Monitoring |
| Hardware Some kind of microcontroler device to capture data on transport use|

- Smart Energy IT systems to dynamicaly allocate energy based on AI Person Detection

| Idea  |
|---|
|Python OpenCV based system |
|Train Model to detect person|
|CuDA GPU C++ to make near realtime|
|Hook into Power Management APIs |

- Traffic Flow Optimisation using AI and predictive analytics 

| Idea  |
|---|
|Route Prediction using Model traffic flow weightings|
|Tom Tom API for realtime Traffic|
|Python produce GIS export to feed into GIS or Gmaps|


- Reducing Data Centre Carbon foot prints by Predective scaling of resorces  

| Idea  |
|---|
|Monitor system use via APIs|
|On-prem , Cloud and Hybrid|
|Front End , Back End|
|K8S , Docker Swarm , Bare Metal |

- Troubled Family Support allocation / intervention based on AI analyitcs of disperte data points (Education , Social Care , Youth Justice , Housing)  

| Idea  |
|---|
|Golden Record|
|Live Access or Flat File|
|Data Conform prcedures|
|Data Rules GDPR|
|Strong Access Controls|
|Model from known interventions triggers to alert that family may need support|
