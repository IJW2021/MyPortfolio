### Week Two [Duo]

This week I spent a fair amount of time going through the reading material some of this was quite heavy going but equally it was also quite interesting and makes a change from the heavy technology modules though being a engineer at heart some of these concepts are quite alien to me but happy to be outside of my comfort zone as that is where growth comes from. Covered topics in 

- What to choose as a research question
- What is research, 
- preparing a project proposal for submission
- writing literature reviews what needs to be inclded. 

Also fedback from the forum post from last week 

### Forum Response

Thanks for your insights into this area, embedded systems is an interesting arena that many people including myself have only recently become aware of. While in the field of healthcare there are existing frameworks and established ethics legislation for dealing with patients and patientâ€™s data The Data Protection Act (DPA) 2018 & GDPR (2018) in the UK along with section 251 (NHS Act 2006) (UK Gov 2006) and HIPPA (HHS 2020) in the United States for devices embedded within the body such as IOT embedded devices these charters may either not fully cover this fairly new branch of medicine. Or be composed before the technology of IOT made the transition from the IT and computing World to the Healthcare world.
 
The risks outlined in the case study show that when technology advances there are risks associated with the adoption of new technology and processes. The existing frameworks used to manage risk and ethics need to keep up with this change. While in the medical field this traditionally at least in the United Kingdom has not been an issue with any new medical technology needing to go through multiple gateways and trials both for technical and ethical compliance via the national institute for health and care excellence NICE before being permitted to be used on real patients. In other areas of the world this may not always be the case.    

As IT professionals there are very few absolutes in our field but one of these is we know that any code including code in embedded devices once it gets above a certain complexity will have bugs, unplanned execution pathways or areas that could be exploited. This is because no code is perfect itâ€™s how these issues are dealt will determine how ethical an organisation is. From your post and the study this company does appear to be at the more ethical end of the scale in doing the right things when an issue is identified. As this Medical IOT field is an area that is evolving new frameworks will also evolve to address any technical and ethical issues that are raised with the adoption of these new medical devices within the realm of Healthcare.

I would think If we revisit this topic in 5 or 10 yearsâ€™ time the ethical and legal landscape is likely to look very different from how it looks today. But issues such as bugs and code having security issues will still remain as it will still be us less than perfect humans writing the embedded systems.
