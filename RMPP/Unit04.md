### Week Four [Hebdomada quattuor]

Unit 4 and this week we are looking at "Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations" interesting topic as in a lot of ways it is something that allready takes place without actually knowing you are doing Observation as research is a technique that is used quite widily in sciences outside of computer science with prime examples being physics where observation is the key research method use. It is also a method that has the least direct impact as observation is a passive method.

### Seminar 3 Prep

The Question posed was 

```
Ricardo works for the records department of his local government as a computer records clerk, where he has access to files of property tax records. For a scientific study, a researcher, Beth, has been granted access to the numerical portion ‚Äúbut not the corresponding names‚Äù of some records.

Beth finds some information that she would like to use, but she needs the names and addresses corresponding with certain properties. Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve these names and addresses, so she can contact these people for more information and for permission to do further study.

Now consider, what are the ethical issues involved in deciding which of these options to pursue?
```

This is something I deal with in my professional life quite frequently working with data and processing FOI requests 

1. If Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, should he release the names and addresses?

Absoulty Not the request at a minium will need to be approved by a line manager or team leader but shoudl really be revied by a IG (Information Goverance) team to ensure that 1. Data use is in line with the permission given when the data was captured if this is not the case then permission from the data subjects would need to be sought (Informed Concent) before any data that was personally identifiable could be released. there may be a cavet if the data was anozimised to but from the description this would remove the purpose the data has been requested.


2. Suppose Ricardo were responsible for determining allowable access to the files. What ethical issues would be involved in his deciding whether to grant access to Beth?

There are a number of factors that need to be taken into consideration to determin if permission should be given from my own personal real world experence of this is has a DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment) been carried out ? would the release of the data fall foul of GDPR and DPA regulations and expose the orginisation to enforcement action from the ICO. If there is any doubt data should not be released and expert advise should be sought from a Data Protection sepecisiest. As the default position shoud be to withhold data when there is any doubt in if the data should be released.

3. Should Beth be allowed to contact the individuals involved? That is, should the Records department release individuals' names to a researcher? What are the ethical issues for the Records department to consider?

Under GDPR and marketing data subjects may have selected no contact or contact by methods such as post , phone , email if this is the case then contact if made would need to take into account these methods. If no contact preferences are on record then the data subject at least in the UK may be registered with the TPS (Telephone Preference Service) so phonecalls may need to take this into consideration. This is one reason why these senarios shoudl be built into the collection model as getting subject concent as the data is collected removes these bigger and more complex issues further down the data use pipeline.

4. Suppose Beth contacts the individuals to ask their permission, and one-third of them respond giving permission, one-third respond denying permission, and one-third do not respond. Beth claims that at least one-half of the individuals are needed to make a valid study. What options are available to Beth?

In many ways this would not be a ideal situation it may be better to collect a new dataset for the research but if Beth did want to do this then any conclusions drawn from the data would have to acknoledge the incomplete state of the data along with any conclusions based on the data shoudl also be adjusted for the size of the provided data.

During this week I have also continued with the initial resarch for the review part of the submission finding it quite hard going reading some of the texts as the language used is in many ways written in a way that would not be keeping in with using plain english where possible and this is from me as a native english speaker. For someone who does not have english as a primany language I would imagine this would be even harder or as my dutch friends would say **In het leven en ook in de taal zijn nuances alles**  (‚ÄúIn life and also in language, nuances are everything.‚Äù) (Louis Couperus 1923)
