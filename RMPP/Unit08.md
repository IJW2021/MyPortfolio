### Week Eight [Hebdomada Octo]

New week new module this week we are looking at  Sample Mean and Sample Standard Deviation 

## Sample Mean

This is defined as "The sample mean (or "empirical mean") and the sample covariance are statistics computed from a sample of data on one or more random variables. The sample mean is the average value (or mean value) of a sample of numbers taken from a larger population of numbers," (Wikipedia 2022 Accessed from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_covariance)

This can be caculated by the formula

n = sum of data items / number of data items

| Value  |
|---|
| 1  |
| 2  |
| 6  |
| 9  |

For the example above the calculation would be 18/4 resulting in a sample mean of 4.5
