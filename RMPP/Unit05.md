### Week Five [Hebdomada Quinque]

Week Five this module is moving fast before long it will be time to subbmit the first piece of assessed work in this week we are going to be looking at Interviews and Survey Methods.

Interesting topic interviews as it is a method that if done correctly is a tool that can achieve better results then the other methods though this does depend in a large part to how the interview and the questions asked are structured. I have used interviews as part of a softmarket testing excerise to scope a potential application development project and in this senario it worked well as getting system requirments was a large part of what we needed to achieve. As the interviewer you do need to be midful of how you ask questions so as not to steer the subject of the interview to a prefered outcome rather then letting them have a free choice when expressing their opinons. Also you need to think about if you want a structured or unstructured interview structured tends to work best for a predefined outcome or a set of questions that will be asked to a number of subject. unstructired is more suitied to getting opnions feeings about a topic or subject. 

## Case Study

Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys
In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.

The background to this case is quite interesting and a lesson in how our lives are lived in a digital space the background in well known in that Cambridge Analytica were able to get access to approx. 87 million Facebook users profile what is less known is the process by how this was achieved the data access / breech was enabled through the work of a researcher Aleksandr Kogan. He had produced an app on Facebook using the Facebook SDK that was a simple quiz the same as anyone who has used Facebook has seen countless times in their timeline. This quiz however took advantage of a weakness in the Facebook platform as normally a Facebook app would only have access to the profile of the person taking the quiz this quiz was written in such a way to also access the profile and data of all the friends of the person taking the quiz.

Under the terms of service of Facebook https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms the selling of this data is not permitted Cambridge Analytica did it anyway Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in response to the scandal

```
‚ÄúWe have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can‚Äôt then we don‚Äôt deserve to serve you, I‚Äôve been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again. The good news is that the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago. But we also made mistakes, there‚Äôs more to do, and we need to step up and do it.‚Äù (Zuckerberg Mark 2018) 
```

What this reenforces is Facebook as a company permitted 3rd party code to run with the sole purpose of harvesting user data with the use of the exploit the scope was far in excess of what should have been possible there were consequences Cambridge Analytica lost a number of clients as the story broke and Facebook were forced to update their AUP and in the context of research a number of ethical researchers have lost access to the platform and data due to the actions by Cambridge Analytica.
