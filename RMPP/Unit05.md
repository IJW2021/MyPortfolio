### Week Five [Hebdomada Quinque]

Week Five this module is moving fast before long it will be time to subbmit the first piece of assessed work in this week we are going to be looking at Interviews and Survey Methods.

Interesting topic interviews as it is a method that if done correctly is a tool that can achieve better results then the other methods though this does depend in a large part to how the interview and the questions asked are structured. I have used interviews as part of a softmarket testing excerise to scope a potential application development project and in this senario it worked well as getting system requirments was a large part of what we needed to achieve. As the interviewer you do need to be midful of how you ask questions so as not to steer the subject of the interview to a prefered outcome rather then letting them have a free choice when expressing their opinons. Also you need to think about if you want a structured or unstructured interview structured tends to work best for a predefined outcome or a set of questions that will be asked to a number of subject. unstructired is more suitied to getting opnions feeings about a topic or subject. 

## Case Study

Case Study: Inappropriate Use of Surveys
In 2018, Cambridge Analytica was in the news in the United Kingdom and the USA (Confessore, 2018) for obtaining and sharing data obtained from millions of Facebook users. They obtained the data through innocuous surveys on Facebook (you may have seen this type of survey and probably participated at times). This is probably the highest profile of surveys used for alternative means and, probably, monetary gains. However, this happens often through various media.

Consider how exactly this happened and why it was used. Find one or two further examples of inappropriate use of surveys and highlight the impact of all these examples from the various ethical, social, legal and professional standpoints that apply.
