### Week Ten [Hebdomada Decem]

During unit 10, I continued the work into code quality and how to write high quality maintaenable code along with this to try and get a better understanding of how these linters work and the decsions they make spent a good amount of time reading the official PEP8 python style guide Guido van Rossum,Barry Warsaw, Nick Coghlan https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.7.x/ while I personally dont agree with eveything contained in the guide max line lenght of 79 characters being a particualr bugbear https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#maximum-line-length having a style guide is an important factor as it allows us to have as far as possible a common framework on how to write well structured code in a style that another deveoper could pick up the code and understand what is contained and how to add to the codebase. This is important because when we look at commercial code development a majority of the work a developer will do involves additions or maitenance to existing codebases rather then virgin deveopment of new applications and solutions.

**Python Linters** 

The Two main Linters in use in the python ecosystem are Pylint and PyFlakes (Previously Flake8) we can also include other code analysis tools such as bandit and sonarqube.
