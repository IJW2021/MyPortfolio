### Week Twelve [Duo Decim]

Unit 12 The end of the module spent alot of the week writing the Reflection piece only to then see that once again stuck with a 1000 word limit was over 2000 words when I noticed that and yes my own fault but still anoying im not a fan when limits stop you expressing what you want to express but they are the limitations we have to work with very like project management thinking about it you have to work within the limitations put on the project be that people or technology. Along with the End of module Piece we also did the demo of our solution hope it was well received. I was aware that 90% of our presentation was me talking would have liked to open it up a bit more to the others to enable them to showcase what they had done but its done learn from the past look to the future. Its been a enjoyable module hopfully I get to put some of what I have learnt into practice
