### Week Eight [Hebdomada Octo]

So we have reached week eight allready scary how fast the module is progressing this week has been a week of looking at data structures in Python an Intersting topic and one that will be useful outside of just the SEPM module and those bits of content and knowledge tend at least in moy opinion are the bits of content I enjoy learning as thay can be applied to new situations and make me a better developer / IT Subject Matter Expert. 

On The Project side Weekly meeting was postive and I think we have an initial direction we want to take I have taken it upon myself to get the infrastructure side setup so that we have a platform we can host the application on its all going to be based on Microservices so planning on going with a standard Linux Host running the docker engine but will confirm with the team developers if they need anything outside of that.

**To DO My Actions for the next week**

- Setup Linux Host
- Install Docker Engine
- Install Portainer To Manage Docker Engine
- Install Webmin to Manage Host
- Ensure all updates have been applied 
- Setup a Domain Name for Project
- Move DNS to CloudFlare
- Decider on Hosting Provider (Azure , AWS , GCP , SelfHosted)


This has been a good week we have a direction just need to steer the course and deliver on the potential the test will be the delivery but so far looking good and feeling positive time will tell if that is well founded.

**Weekly Skills Matrix New Knowledge Gained**

- [x] Refresher on Python DataTypes
- [x] Infrastructure Build Out

**Happiness Level**
