### Week Seven [Hebdomada Septem]

First week of the actual impelemenation lets see if we can put our design into practice we have two developers in the split of roles for the team so while they look at the code side im going to start by putting together some of the documents we will need for the project. One of the advantages of having been on real world projects is having a rough Idea of how the documents should be structured. First one we will need is a PID and then a RAID log to capture the risks and issues.
