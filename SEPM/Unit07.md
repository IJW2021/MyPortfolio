### Week Seven [Hebdomada Septem]

First week of the actual impelemenation lets see if we can put our design into practice we have two developers in the split of roles for the team so while they look at the code side im going to start by putting together some of the documents we will need for the project. One of the advantages of having been on real world projects is having a rough Idea of how the documents should be structured. First one we will need is a PID and then a RAID log to capture the risks and issues.

First action will be to book a regular update meeting with the rest of the team to allow progress to be tracked as the key to any successful project is good communication as we all have zoom this will be the channel I will recommend for team comunications. I am Looking forward to putting our design together do have a few reservations about the project but hopfuly these wont hold back what we need to deliver

One thing I am beginging to reliase is a project manager has a lot to consider when managing a project from responding to the customer but also internal resource management and keeping the project on track. It is these oftern unseen parts of the project management role that can have a big affect on the success or failure of a project so im going to do some work in this area along with speaking to the design team on how they plan to implement the solution hopfully shoudl be a week where we can make some stedy progress.
