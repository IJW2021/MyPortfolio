## My History
From an early age Iâ€™ve always been deeply interested in science and engineering, The first time I used a computer right at the beginning of the computer revolution I wanted to know how these mysterious machines worked. Thus began my journey into the World of IT and computing learning how to program learning how to build computers. And how a passion for technology turned into a career.
